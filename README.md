This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React Router DOM v6 involving unexpected routing behavior when nested routes are used in conjunction with path or query parameters.  The bug manifests as incorrect route matching or unexpected component rendering under certain navigation scenarios.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected implementation that avoids the issue.  The issue is related to how React Router handles route matching and parameter resolution within nested route structures. The solution involves carefully restructuring the routes to resolve the parameter ambiguities and ensure correct matching.
